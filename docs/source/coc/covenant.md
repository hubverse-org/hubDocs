# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct  

## Our pledge  

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.  

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.  

## Our standards  

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:**  

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience  
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals but for the overall community  

**Examples of unacceptable behavior include:**  
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances of any kind  
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission  
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Enforcement responsibilities  

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying our standards of acceptable behavior. Enforcement is the responsibility of the [Code of Conduct Committee](/coc/committee.md), who will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.  

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to any Code of Conduct Committee member. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The Code of Conduct Committee will use the [Enforcement Manual](/coc/enforcement-manual.md) to determine the consequences of any action they deem violating this Code of Conduct. All community leaders and Code of Conduct Committee members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.  

## Scope  

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and when an individual officially represents the community in public spaces. Representing our community includes using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
