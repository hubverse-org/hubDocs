# Enforcement manual

This is the enforcement manual used by the [Code of Conduct Committee](/coc/committee.md) when they respond to an issue to ensure consistency and fairness. Enforcement of the Code of Conduct (CoC) should be respectful and not include harassing behaviors.

## Urgent situations: acting unilaterally

If the incident involves physical danger or a threat to anyone’s safety (such as threats of violence), any community member may – and should – act unilaterally to protect the safety of any community member. Actions can include contacting law enforcement (or other local personnel) and speaking on behalf of the hubverse team.

If the act is ongoing, any community member may act immediately before reaching a consensus to diffuse the situation. In ongoing situations, any member may, at their discretion, employ any of the tools available in this enforcement manual, including bans and blocks online or removal from a physical space.

When an individual community member acts unilaterally, they must inform the CoC Committee as soon as possible and report their actions for review within 24 hours.

## Less urgent situations

Upon receiving a report of an incident, the CoC Committee will review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

- whether this is an ongoing situation
- whether there is a threat to anyone’s physical safety
- what happened
- whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
- who, if anyone, was the bad actor

This information will be collected either in person or in writing. The CoC Committee will provide a written summary of the information surrounding the incident. All participants will be anonymized in the summary report, referred to as “Community Member 1”, “Community Member 2”, or “Research Team Member 1”. The “de-anonymizing key” will be kept in a separate file and only accessed to link repeated reports against the same person over time.

The CoC Committee will aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one week. If a resolution can’t be determined in that time frame, a member of the CoC Committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.

## Resolutions

The CoC Committee will seek to agree on a resolution by consensus of all members investigating the report. If any of the committee members cannot participate in the discussion due to a conflict of interest, an external member of the CoC Committee will assume duties.

Possible responses may include:
- A mediated conversation or agreement between the impacted community members.
- A request for a verbal or written apology, public or private, from a community member.
- A public announcement clarifying community responsibilities under the Code of Conduct.
- Nothing - if the issue reported is not a violation or outside of the scope of this Code of Conduct.
- A private in-person conversation between a member of the committee and the individual(s) involved. In this case, the person who has the conversation will provide a written summary for record keeping.
- A private written reprimand from a committee member to the individual(s) involved. In this case, the committee member will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc’ing all committee members for record keeping.
- A public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue where the violation occurred (such as on the listserv for a listserv violation and GitHub for a GitHub violation). The committee may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
- An imposed “time out” from online spaces. Committee members will communicate this “time out” to the individual(s) involved.
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all hubverse project spaces (like on GitHub, online calls or in-person events). The committee will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed and extended to a Code of Conduct safety team as it is built or otherwise maintained. If a community member is removed from an event, they will not be reimbursed for any part of the event they miss.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, a member of the CoC Committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The CoC Committee member will ask if this resolution is acceptable and must note feedback for the record. However, the CoC Committee is not required to act on this feedback.

## Conflicts of interest

If the report concerns someone on the committee, please send the report to the other individuals on the committee.
