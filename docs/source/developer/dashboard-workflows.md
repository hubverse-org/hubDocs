# Dashboard operational workflows

:::{admonition} Required reading

You are expected to know _how_ the build process of the
dashboard works with respect to being able to identify the tools involved, the
inputs, and the outputs are. If you cannot yet identify these elements, please
go and read the [local dashboard workflow chapter](./dashboard-local.md).

## An analogy for operations

The purpose of this chapter is concerned with **operational aspects** of
building a dashboard. If you are reading this chapter, you know how to build
the dashboard and you can build a dashboard locally.

To given an imperfect analogy, this is a lot like knowing how to cook a meal
for five people. You know the ingredients you need, the tools you can use, and
the steps necessary to complete the recipe. You already have the ingredients
and the tools and you can spend a little time in your kitchen to produce
something that is satisfying and delicious.

Imagine now that you still have this knowledge about the ingredients and tools,
but instead of working in your own kitchen, you are now working in an industrial
kitchen and are cooking for 50 people. You _may_ be able to do everything on
your own, but it's better to have help. So now, you have other people helping
with the prep, such as dicing the vegetables, sharpening the knives, preparing
the sauces, and cleaning up. You have to think about _when_ specific parts
of the recipe need to be executed, _where_ in the kitchen you have space to
hold the final components, and how to handle variations in the recipe.
