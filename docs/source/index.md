# The hubverse: open tools for collaborative modeling

```{admonition} What is The Hubverse For?
:class: seealso

**The goal of the hubverse** is to **ensure stakeholders have model summaries they can trust** by facilitating collaborative modelling efforts that are rapidly validated and summarized.
While this effort has been developed by scientists who focus on modelling of outbreaks, **hubverse concepts and tooling are general enough to have a broader range of applications**.

The hubverse is a collection of open-source software and data tools that enables collaborative modeling exercises. It is developed by **the Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs**, a collaboration of research teams and public health professionals that have built and maintained predictive modeling hubs for infectious disease applications. Working together, we have developed the hubverse for groups that are running collaborative modeling hub efforts. This website documents the requirements for using the hubverse.  

The [overview](overview/who-we-are.md) section provides an introduction to the project, and the [getting started](quickstart-hub-admin/getting-started.md) section outlines how to set up a working hub, as well as the different resources created by this project.
