# How to contribute

The Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs built *the hubverse* collaboratively and we benefit from your contributions.

## Use and test our software and tools

The hubverse was created for teams to easily create and set-up collaborative modeling hubs, and we benefit from having groups use these tools and tell us about it.

## File issues

Let us know if something is not working for you or if something could improve. This could be a bug in the code, a case where the tools are not appropriate for your use case, a problem with the documentation, or something else. Issues can be filed in any of the hubverse repositories. You are also welcome to join the discussion on any existing issue in any of the hubverse repositories.

## Contribute code

If you are an interested in contributing to *the hubverse*, please see [guidelines for contributing](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubUtils/CONTRIBUTING.html).

## Start to run a hub

If you are interested in using *the hubverse* to run a hub, please consider joining our monthly "community hubverse meetings". During these meetings, we provide general updates from a broad mix of developers and public health representatives running hubs or thinking about starting to run hubs.

To join the "community hubverse meeting", please send an email to <a href="mailto:hubverse+owner@groups.io">the hubverse group</a>, including your name, email and a few sentences about how you would like to use the hubverse.

## Join development team

If you are an experienced programmer and interested in joining the development team, we have "development meetings" on all Wednesdays, except the first Wednesday of the month. These development meetings are for technical updates/discussions about ongoing development tasks.

To join the development team, please send an email to <a href="mailto:hubverse+owner@groups.io">the hubverse group</a>, including your name, email and a few sentences about what you can contribute to the development team.

## Governance

The governing body of the [Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs](who-we-are.md) is the Coding Council, which is made up of any member of the community who is in attendance at one of the periodic virtual meetings. This council in general serves as a deliberative body, discussing and setting directions for new conceptual and software development. In general, decisions about design and prioritization are made through consensus at the Coding Council level. If differences arise that cannot be solved by consensus, then decisions are passed along to the Steering Committee, which is made up of three members. Members of the Steering Committee serve one year terms, with elections occurring in July of each calendar year. Members of the Coding Council may nominate themselves or others to serve on the Steering Committee, and a closed-ballot vote is taken if more than three individuals are nominated. The highest three vote-getters serve on the council.

The affiliated modeling hubs are described [here](who-we-are.md).

On July 10, 2024 the following members of the steering committee were elected: 

- Evan Ray, US Forecast Hub
- Lucie Contamin, University of Pittsburgh, MIDAS
- Anna Krystalli, R-RSE
