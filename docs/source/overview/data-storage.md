# Data storage

There are three supported options for data storage/archiving:

## 1. [`GitHub repositories`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories)

GitHub is an online software development platform. GitHub repositories can store project files, track their revision history, and allow collaboration, discussion, and management among various team members. Itâ€™s free and has become central in the movement toward open-source software.


## 2. [`AWS buckets`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html)

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers scalability, data availability, security, and performance for projects of different sizes, including data storage and analytics.

The Hubverse team will provide S3 hosting upon request. Hub administrators interested in using S3 should contact the team for more information.


## 3. [`Zoltar`](https://zoltardata.com/about)

Zoltar is a research data repository that stores forecasts made by external models in standard formats and provides tools for retrieval, validation, visualization, analysis, and scoring. Please visit the [Zoltar documentation site](https://docs.zoltardata.com/) for more information.
