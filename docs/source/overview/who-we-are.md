# Who we are  

The Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs brings together groups that have worked on developing and running modeling hubs in different outbreak prediction settings, in collaboration with national and international health agencies, such as the US and European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The initial modeling hubs were developed with a focus on providing nowcasts, forecasts, or scenario projections of outbreaks. While the infrastructure we developed to support these efforts are readily generalizable to other applications, we note that these motivating examples were for applications that focused on (a) predictive modeling and (b) outbreak settings.

Building off of systems designed for influenza forecasting challenges led by the US CDC, the [Reich Lab at UMass-Amherst](https://reichlab.io/), in collaboration with the [US CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/), developed the [US COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.org/) in early 2020 to support COVID-19 forecasting efforts. This infrastructure was later adapted for use by several other modeling hubs:

 - [German/Poland COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://github.com/KITmetricslab/covid19-forecast-hub-de)
 - [US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub](https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-scenario-modeling-hub)
 - [European COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://github.com/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/covid19-forecast-hub-europe)
 - [German Hospitalization Nowcast Hub](https://github.com/KITmetricslab/hospitalization-nowcast-hub)
 - [US Influenza FluSight 2022 Challenge](https://github.com/cdcepi/Flusight-forecast-data)

## Hubverse retreat
Our second annual “hubverse retreat” was held June 3-7, 2024 at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. This year’s retreat focused on the future of hubs in the cloud, dashboarding, and the archiving of hub data using hubverse standards.
