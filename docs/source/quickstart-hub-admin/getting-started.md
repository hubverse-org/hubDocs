# Getting started  

To host a modeling hub, you must decide where to host, store, and archive the data. We support [three data storage options](../overview/data-storage.md), but we will focus on GitHub for this quickstart guide.  

## Step 1: Create or open your GitHub account  

You can go ahead and move on to the next step if you already have a GitHub account.  If you do not have a GitHub account, [follow these instructions to create a GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) (a free account is fine).  

## Step 2: Make a copy of the GitHub template repository  

Go to [hubTemplate](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubTemplate) and click on "Use this template". Select "Create a new repository".

:target: https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubTemplate
```

## Step 3: Name and create the repository  

Enter a name for your repositoryâ€”you can use any name.  Then click on "Create repository".

- This repository ("repo") will be saved on your GitHub account.

## Step 4: Clone your repository  

Clone the repo to your computer so that you can work with it locally.  GitHub has [instructions on how to clone a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).  

## Congratulations!  

You have just created your first hub repository from the Hubverse. You can read about [the structure of hub repositories](../user-guide/hub-structure.md) and explore the repository on your computer.
