# Uploading and validating config files  

You have now made all the changes necessary to start using the simple hub, but the changes to `admin.json` and `tasks.json` are only on your local computer. You want to move them to your GitHub repository.

## Uploading changes from your local computer to GitHub  

Follow GitHub directions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) for adding files to a repository.  

Once you have uploaded those two files onto your GitHub repository, you will notice that they have been updated by looking at the last commit date, as indicated below.

## Validating your config files  

Now you should validate the config files, to be sure they are properly functional. You can use the `validate_config` function from [`hubAdmin`](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubAdmin/index.html) to check whether Hub config files are valid. The steps are as follows:  

1. First, you need to install the R package `hubAdmin`. [Here are instructions for installing `hubAdmin` in the R console](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubAdmin#installation).  
2. Next, you need to validate the Hub's config files. 
- [`validate_hub_config()`](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubAdmin/reference/validate_hub_config.html) validates the `admin.json`, `tasks.json`, `model-metadata-schema.json` Hub config files in a single call.
- [`validate_config()`](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubAdmin/reference/validate_config.html) a hub config file against a Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs schema.
- If you do get any errors, you can pass the result of any of the above functions to `view_config_val_errors()` which print a concise and informative version of validation errors table.

## Congratulations!  

Your simple hub repository is now ready to be used! You created a simple hub and modified the `config.json` and `task.json` files. You now have:  
- [x] Created a hub repository
- [x] Cloned the hub repository to your local computer
- [x] Configured the modeling hub by: 
  - [x] Modifying `admin.json`
  - [x] Modifying `tasks.json`
- [x] Uploaded modified files from your local computer to GitHub
- [x] Validated config files
