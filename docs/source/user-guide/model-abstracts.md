# Model abstracts

## Directory structure
The `model-abstracts` directory in a modeling hub is an optional feature, but if included, it must have the following subdirectory and file structure:
* `team1-modela`
   * `<round-id1>.md`
   * `<round-id2>.md`
* `team1-modelb`
   * `<round-id1>.md`
* `team2-modela`
   * `<round-id1>.md`

There is one directory for each team; within that, there are possibly multiple files, one for each round.

## Purpose

The `model-abstracts` directory is an optional hub feature that may be useful for keeping track of round-specific detailed narrative descriptions of modeling methods and results, e.g., describing modeling assumptions specific to one modeling round. Note: hubs may find it helpful to associate round-specific metadata with the corresponding model output files as part of a separate workflow.

Note: [model metadata](../user-guide/model-metadata.md) is a required feature of a hub and describes the characteristics of models contributing to a hub, while model abstracts are an optional feature of a hub that is useful for keeping track of round-specific detailed narrative descriptions modeling methods and results.
