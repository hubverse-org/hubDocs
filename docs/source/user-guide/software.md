# Software  

To assist users in building a hub, we have developed a software suite with specific functions and uses outlined below. These tools are designed to support common modeling hub tasks, like loading model output data, plotting the model output data, building ensembles using the data, and in some cases evaluating the predictions made by different models.  

## [`hubAdmin`](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubAdmin)  

`hubAdmin` is an R package that contains utility functions for administering hubs, in particular creating and validating hub configuration files. You can find the complete package and instructions for use [here](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubAdmin).    

## [`hubData`](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubData)  

`hubData` is an R package that provides tools for connecting to, interacting with, and manipulating hub data. You can find the complete package and instructions for use [here](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubData).   

## [`hubEnsembles`](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubEnsembles)  

`hubEnsembles` is an R package with functionality to build simple ensembles of data from modeling hubs. Different ensembles can be built using for instance the mean, median, and mode. You can find the complete package and instructions for use [here](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubEnsembles).  

## [`hubExamples`](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubExamples)  

`hubExamples` is an R package that provides example data for forecasting and scenario modeling hubs in the hubverse format. You can find the complete package and instructions for use [here](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubExamples). 

## [`hubUtils`](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubUtils/)  

`hubUtils` is a lightweight R package that primarily contains general utilities imported by other hubverse packages. Previously, `hubUtils` was a larger package with more functions, but most of these were moved and split across `hubData` and `hubAdmin`.   

## [`hubValidations`](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubValidations)  

`hubValidations` is an R package that facilitates the implementation of general validation rules that are enforced on submissions in the form of pull requests to hub repositories. You can find the complete package and instructions for use [here](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubValidations).  

## [`hubverse`](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubverse) 

`hubverse` is a collection of packages that enables collaborative modeling exercises through a unified framework for aggregating, visualizing,
and evaluating forecasts. This package is designed to make it easy to install and load multiple `hubverse` packages in a single step. You can
find the complete package and instructions for use [here](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubverse).  

## [`hubVis`](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubVis)  

`hubVis` is an R package that provides plotting methods for hub model outputs in order to synthesize and visualize model submissions. You can find the complete package and instructions for use [here](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubVis).
